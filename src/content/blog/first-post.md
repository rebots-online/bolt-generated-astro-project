# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my new blog! This is my first post, created using Astro.

## What I've learned

Astro is a powerful static site generator that allows you to use various frontend frameworks and vanilla JavaScript to build fast, content-focused websites.

Some key features of Astro include:

1. Component Islands
2. Zero JS by default
3. Edge-ready
4. Customizable

I'm excited to explore more of what Astro has to offer!
